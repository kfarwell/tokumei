pre-launch:
* fix misaligned search bar in webkit and ie11 - looks like a
  materialize bug <https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/2229>
  but fix manually if upstream doesn't fix it before launch
* finish post creation form
    * file uploads (img, audio, video, 3d embeds can be adapted from
      scholarly/werchan)
      * materialize has a fancy card for image posts
    * separate field for urls? - they probably shouldn't count towards
      the character limit
* better page titles
* write a privacy policy
* get sued by american eagle
* finalize name, logo
* register domain (probably tokumei.co)
* set up server

w/e:
* write something on the homepage maybe (maybe tell people what the site
  is) - maybe should involve a switch to a hipster parallax homepage
  (materialize has an example)
  * why should someone use tokumei?
    * it's like twitter - why do people use twitter?
       * it's easy - tokumei moreso and especially compared to anonymous
         text/imageboards (~2 clicks to post, no registration)
    * it's anonymous - 2ch/4chan/8chan/etc have good arguments for this
      * "Channel4 differs significantly in comparison to other western
        forums. First and foremostly, you can not "register". There is no
        membership of any sorts, and users are encouraged from not posting
        their name, nickname or any other personal details to their
        identity. Why? Because we believe what you have to say is far more
        important as to who you are."

* write other useful pages? an about page?
* document "api"
  * /p/0.txt - plaintext post
  * /p/0_werc/tagindex - tags
  * /p/0_werc/replies/0 - reply
  * /p/0_werc/postnum - number of replies
  * /_werc/tags/ - tag indices
* add rss feeds for tag searches
  * built-in feed reader ("tag following")? harmful for privacy but not
    more than external feed readers I guess - cookies, not accounts;
    need easy exporting/importing/backing-up maybe
* somehow don't let tags get too close to the reply/share buttons
* add more share links (reddit lacks an icon - make one)
* some visual indicator of tag separation in the post form
* maybe make tags case insensitive - hard but normies cannot into case
  sensitivity
* refactor
  * move txt_handler to a tpl
  * remove and rewrite old terrible werchan/scholarly code
    * some of this is ignorant to werc conventions and just needs to be
      moved to eg. apps
      * backport to werchan/scholarly
