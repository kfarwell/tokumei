* improve alignment in .card-action
  * reduce visual separation of contents from .card-content when there
    are no tags <http://tokumei.co/p/48>
* fix misaligned search bar in webkit and ie11 - looks like a
  materialize bug <https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/2229>
  but fix manually if upstream doesn't fix it before launch
* finish post creation form
  * file uploads (img, audio, video, 3d embeds can be adapted from
    scholarly/werchan)
    * materialize has a fancy card for image posts
  * separate field for urls? - they probably shouldn't count towards
    the character limit
  * some visual indicator of tag separation
* document "api"
  * /p/0.txt - plaintext post
  * /p/0_werc/tagindex - tags
  * /p/0_werc/replies/0 - reply
  * /p/0_werc/postnum - number of replies
  * /_werc/tags/ - tag indices
* add rss feeds for tag searches
  * built-in feed reader ("tag following")? harmful for privacy but not
    more than external feed readers I guess - cookies, not accounts;
    need easy exporting/importing/backing-up maybe
* maybe make tags case insensitive - hard but normies cannot into case
  sensitivity
* refactor
  * remove and rewrite old terrible werchan/scholarly code
    * some of this is ignorant to werc conventions and just needs to be
      moved to eg. apps
      * backport to werchan/scholarly
