* styling
  * improve alignment in .card-action
    * reduce visual separation of contents from .card-content when there
      are no tags <http://tokumei.co/p/48>
  * fix misaligned search bar in webkit and ie11 - looks like a
    materialize bug <https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/2229>
    but fix manually if upstream doesn't fix it
  * refactor style.css
* finish post creation form
  * file uploads (img, audio, video, 3d embeds can be adapted from
    scholarly/werchan)
    * materialize has a fancy card for image posts
  * separate field for urls? - they probably shouldn't count towards
    the character limit
  * separate tags by commas, not spaces
  * some visual indicator of tag separation - render tag .chips as they
    are entered
* built-in feed reader ("tag following") - save tag list in cookie,
  backup to / restore from server
* additional post index - recent controversial posts with popular tags
* refactor
  * remove and rewrite old terrible werchan/scholarly code
    * some of this is ignorant to werc conventions and just needs to be
      moved to eg. apps
      * backport to werchan/scholarly
