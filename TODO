posting:
 - implement API key generation / validation
 - add CAPTCHA support (alongside API keys)

attachments:
 - do not preserve file names
 - strip EXIF data (JPEG/TIFF) (see issue #1)
 - strip XMP metadata (PNG, possibily other containers)
 - create new metadata package that handles stripping this information

tests:
 - none of the code on this branch has tests yet
 - tests need to be added for each package to prevent accidental regressions
