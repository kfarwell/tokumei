pre-launch:
* fix misaligned search bar in webkit and ie11 - looks like a
  materialize bug <https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/2229>
  but fix manually if upstream doesn't fix it before launch
* fix main post index (/p/) - this is implemented from scholarly/werchan
  but needs to be updated for the new tokumei post format at least
  * update post creation form (dirdir) for new post format
    * 140 character limit - do limits other than 140 work better? some
      gnu social instances experiment with others
    * add minimal version to txt_handler for replies
    * file uploads (img, audio, video, 3d embeds can be adapted from
      scholarly/werchan)
      * materialize has a fancy card for image posts
    * separate field for tags - I think this encourages quality tagging
    * separate field for urls? - they probably shouldn't count towards
      the character limit
* fix post pages (/p/0) - same as above
* write a privacy policy

w/e:
* write something on the homepage maybe (maybe tell people what the site
  is) - maybe should involve a switch to a hipster parallax homepage
  (materialize has an example)
  * why should someone use tokumei?
    * it's like twitter - why do people use twitter?
       * it's easy - tokumei moreso and especially compared to anonymous
         text/imageboards (~2 clicks to post, no registration)
    * it's anonymous - 2ch/4chan/8chan/etc have good arguments for this
      * "Channel4 differs significantly in comparison to other western
        forums. First and foremostly, you can not "register". There is no
        membership of any sorts, and users are encouraged from not posting
        their name, nickname or any other personal details to their
        identity. Why? Because we believe what you have to say is far more
        important as to who you are."

* write other useful pages? an about page?
* document "api"
  * /p/0.txt - plaintext post
  * /p/0_werc/tags/ - tags (needs an index)
  * /p/0_werc/replies/ - replies
  * /_werc/tags/ - tag indices
* add rss feeds for tag searches
  * built-in feed reader ("tag following")? harmful for privacy but not
    more than external feed readers I guess - cookies, not accounts;
    need easy exporting/importing/backing-up maybe
* somehow don't let tags get too close to the reply/share buttons
* add more share links (reddit lacks an icon - make one)
* maybe make tags case insensitive - hard but normies cannot into case
  sensitivity
* refactor
  * move txt_handler to a tpl
  * remove and rewrite old terrible werchan/scholarly code
    * some of this is ignorant to werc conventions and just needs to be
      moved to eg. apps
      * backport to werchan/scholarly
