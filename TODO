* styling
  * improve alignment in .card-action
  * fix misaligned search bar in webkit and ie11 - looks like a
    materialize bug <https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/2229>
    but fix manually if upstream doesn't fix it
  * refactor style.css
* finish post creation form
  * allow uploading files with a proper form instead of urls
  * some visual indicator of tag separation - render tag .chips as they
    are entered
* add backup/restore for followed tags
* use consistent character counting (maxlength, length, awk)
* refactor
  * remove and rewrite old terrible werchan/scholarly code
    * some of this is ignorant to werc conventions and just needs to be
      moved to eg. apps
      * backport to werchan/scholarly
