ABOUT
=====

Tokumei is written in rc, the Plan 9 shell, using the werc minimal web
framework. The front end uses the Materialize CSS/JS library.

For an introduction to rc, see <http://rc.cat-v.org/>.
For an introduction to werc, see <http://werc.cat-v.org/>.
For an introduction to Materialize, see <http://materializecss.com/>.

Also see the werc docs for instructions on deploying your own Tokumei server.

In addition to the standard werc setup, you will probably want a cronjob to add
trending tags to sites/tokumei.co/_werc/trending:

  cd /path/to/tokumei/sites/tokumei.co/_werc/tags
  wc -l * | sort -r | sed -n '2,11p' | sed 's/.* //' >../trending

Many thanks to uriel and cat-v for werc.
