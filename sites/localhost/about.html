<h1>About</h1>

<p>Where would you go if you wanted to see the kinds of things students around the world are building, the kinds of paintings and sculptures they're making, and ultimately the ideas they're excited about?</p>

<p>That's what we're creating with Scholarly&mdash;a portal that connects students and academics.</p>

<p>Inspiration for this site came from spending time in the Fine Arts building at the University of Waterloo. This building, with a very simple exterior, is thoroughly vibrant with various paintings, sculptures and new media art displayed on the walls.</p>

<p><a href="https://scholarly.me/">Scholarly.me</a> is being built with tender loving care by <a href="http://shlomotion.io/">@shlomotion</a> and <a href="http://kfarwell.org/">Kyle Farwell</a>.
