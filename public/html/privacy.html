    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p><b>Post information:</b> When you create a post on {{.Conf.Title}}, we record the following until either (1) you choose to delete your own post using the deletion password you set when you created the post or (2) {{.Conf.Title}} staff deletes the post for breaking a {{.Conf.Title}} <a href="/rules" class="pink-text">rule</a>:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The text that you post;</li>
        <li>The terms that you tag your post with, if any;</li>
        <li>The file that you upload with your post, if any;</li>
        <li>The time and date that you submit your post;</li>
        <li>The deletion password that you choose for your post, if any. Your deletion password is stored hashed and salted.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>Cookies:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>When you modify your preference for the number of posts to be displayed on each page of the post index, we set a cookie in your browser to keep track of your preference in the future. You can avoid this cookie being set by not modifying this setting with the form pictured below.</li>

        <li>When you modify your preferences in the <a href="/settings" class="pink-text">settings</a>, we set a cookie in your browser to keep track of your preference in the future. You can avoid this cookie being set by not submitting the form on the settings page.</li>
        <li>When you follow a tag, we set a cookie in your browser to keep track of which posts to show you on the <a href="/p/following">Following index</a> in the future. You can avoid this cookie being set by not following tags with the button pictured below.</li>
        <img class="responsive-img" src="/img/follow.png" alt="The tag following form" />
    </ol>

    <p><b>Follow backups:</b> When you export your followed tags from the <a href="/p/following" class="pink-text">Following index</a>, we record a list of the tags you are following, indefinitely. You can avoid this being stored by not exporting your followed tags.</p>

    {{if $apikeys}}
    <p><b>API keys:</b> If you <a href="/getkey" class="pink-text">request an API key</a>, we temporarily store the email address you provide, as well as the most recent time that a post was made using your key.</p>
    {{end}}

    <h2>How we use this information</h2>
    <p><b>Post information:</b> With the exception of the deletion password, this information is made public in your posts on {{.Conf.Title}}. Anyone can see it. We (or anyone else) may analyze this public information that you submit for any purpose. The deletion password is stored so that you can delete your post at a later date, should you choose.</p>

    <p><b>Cookies:</b> We only read your browser's cookies to (1) change the number of posts displayed for you per your preference, to (2) change {{.Conf.Title}}'s visual appearance per your preference, and to (3) filter the posts that are showed to you on the <a href="/p/following" class="pink-text">Following index</a>.</p>

    <p><b>Follow backups:</b> Your backups are only accessed in order to restore them for you when you choose to import them from the <a href="/p/following" class="pink-text">Following index</a>.</p>

    {{if $apikeys}}
    <p><b>API keys:</b> If you have requested an API key, we ask for your email to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Verify your email before issuing your key.</li>
        <li>Ensure that multiple keys are not issued to the same email address.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We also keep the most recent time a post was made using your key. If the key has been inactive for the past 6 months, it will be revoked.</li>
    <p>We do <b>not</b>:
    <ol>
        <li>Associate keys with posts once they have been made.</li>
        <li>Keep your email on file after it has been verified and the key has been issued. Your email address is put through a one-way hash to generate your API key. It should be very difficult for any party to reverse this process and obtain your email address from the key.</p>
    </ol>
    {{end}}

    <h2>Information we do not collect</h2>
    <p>Everything else! We do not store your IP address or any additional information about you for any amount of time.</p>
